A Github Pages template for my personal website. It is the modified version of academicpages.
The original template can be found in [this repository](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io).

If you would like to use this template, the key files to make changes are:

```
_config.yml
_pages/about.html
```

If you would like to add blog posts, put the files in either md or html format under _posts directory. If you would like them to be chronologically ordered, indicate the publication date in the filename, i.e. 2023-12-17-my-blog-post-1.md.

If you would like to add new single pages, such as for projects, teaching, CV and so on, you need to add the html files under _pages directory and add them to _data/navigation.yml. 

You can choose different layout options from _layouts option for a new page, or design your own and add it to _layouts folder.
