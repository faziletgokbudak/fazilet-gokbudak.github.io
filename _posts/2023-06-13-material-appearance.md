description: Material properties define its appearance. How do we represent the appearance of materials?

The realistic rendering of scenes requires a precise description of how real-world materials scatter light. Here, the appearance of a material can be defined as a function of how that material interacts with light. The material can reflect light or cause it to diffuse beneath the surface, a complex phenomena known as subsurface scattering.

Reflectance describes the amount of light reflected from the surface of a material. In general, the amount of reflected light may change at each point on the surface, and for each possible direction of incoming ($\omega_i$) and outgoing ($\omega_o$) light. Therefore, a complete way of representing the reflectance properties of a material is by defining a 6-dimensional function f($\omega_i$, $\omega_o$, **x**) of how light is reflected at location x of the surface, which is known as spatially-varying bidirectional reflectance distribution function (SVBRDF).

## Bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF)

Simplifying the SVBRDF, let's start with a 4-dimensional function of incident and reflected lights $\omega_i$ and $\omega_r$. The BRDF outputs the ratio of reflected radiance leaving the surface along $\omega_r$ to the irradiance coming from direction $\omega_i$. The directions are parameterized by two angles, azimuth angle $\phi$ and $\theta$, making the function with four variables. So,


$$BRDF: f(\theta_i, \phi_i, \theta_r, \phi_r) = \frac{L(\theta_r, \phi_r)}{E(\theta_i, \phi_i)}$$ where $E(\theta_i, \phi_i)$ is the irradiance due to the source in direction $\omega_i$ and $L(\theta_r, \phi_r)$ is the radiance of surface in direction $\omega_r$. 

BRDF completely describes the reflectance properties of any point on the material surface. Some of its properties are:

- $f(\theta_i, \phi_i, \theta_r, \phi_r) > 0$. Radiance and irradiance cannot be negative. Hence, BRDF should be non-negative.
- Helmholtz reciprocity: $f(\theta_i, \phi_i, \theta_r, \phi_r) = f(\theta_r, \phi_r, \theta_i, \phi_i)$, which means BRDF doesn't change when the illumination and reflectance directions are flipped. That is, the reflectance properties of the surface at a point will be the same.

For *rotationally symmetric reflectance (isotropic surfaces)*, BRDF is a 3-D function: $f(\theta_i, \theta_r, \phi_i - \phi_r)$. If a surface is isotropic, it means that the brightness of the point of interest on the surface remains the same when the surface spins around its surface normal. In other words, the image/appearance of the material surface will not change when the surface is rotated. It happens especially when the surface has grooves which are directional.
