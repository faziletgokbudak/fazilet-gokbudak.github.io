The realistic rendering of scenes requires a precise description of how real-world materials scatter light. Here, the appearance of a material can be defined as a function of how that material interacts with light. The material can reflect light or cause it to diffuse beneath the surface, a complex phenomena known as subsurface scattering.

Reflectance describes the amount of light reflected from the surface of a material. In general, the amount of reflected light may change at each point on the surface, and for each possible direction of incoming (w_i) and outgoing (w_o) light. Therefore, a complete way of representing the reflectance properties of a material is by defining a 6-dimensional function f(w_i, w_o, x) of how light is reflected at location x of the surface, which is known as spatially-varying bidirectional reflectance distribution function (SVBRDF).
