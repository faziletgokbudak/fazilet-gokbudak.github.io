The realistic rendering of scenes requires a precise description of how real-world materials scatter light. Here, the appearance of a material can be defined as a function of how that material interacts with light. The material can reflect light or cause it to diffuse beneath the surface, a complex phenomena known as subsurface scattering.

Reflectance describes the amount of light reflected from the surface of a material. In general, the amount of reflected light may change at each point on the surface, and for each possible direction of incoming ($\omega_i$) and outgoing ($\omega_o$) light. Therefore, a complete way of representing the reflectance properties of a material is by defining a 6-dimensional function f($\omega_i$, $\omega_o$, **x**) of how light is reflected at location x of the surface, which is known as spatially-varying bidirectional reflectance distribution function (SVBRDF).

## Bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF)

Simplifying the SVBRDF, let's start with a 4-dimensional function of incident and reflected lights $\omega_i$ and $\omega_r$. The BRDF outputs the ratio of reflected radiance leaving the surface along $\omega_r$ to the irradiance coming from direction $\omega_i$. The directions are parameterized by two angles, azimuth angle $\phi$ and $\theta$, making the function with four variables. So,


$$BRDF: f(\theta_i, \phi_i, \theta_r, \phi_r) = \frac{L(\theta_r, \phi_r)}{E(\theta_i, \phi_i)}$$ where $E(\theta_i, \phi_i)$ is the irradiance due to the source in direction $\omega_i$ and $L(\theta_r, \phi_r)$ is the radiance of surface in direction $\omega_r$. 

BRDF completely describes the reflectance properties of any point on the material surface. Some of its properties are:

- $f(\theta_i, \phi_i, \theta_r, \phi_r) > 0$. Radiance and irradiance cannot be negative. Hence, BRDF should be non-negative.
- Helmholtz reciprocity: $f(\theta_i, \phi_i, \theta_r, \phi_r) = f(\theta_r, \phi_r, \theta_i, \phi_i)$, which means BRDF doesn't change when the illumination and reflectance directions are flipped. That is, the reflectance properties of the surface at a point will be the same.

For **rotationally symmetric reflectance (isotropic surfaces)**, BRDF is a 3-D function: $f(\theta_i, \theta_r, \phi_i - \phi_r)$. If a surface is isotropic, it means that the brightness of the point of interest on the surface remains the same when the surface spins around its surface normal. In other words, the image/appearance of the material surface will not change when the surface is rotated. It happens especially when the surface has grooves which are directional.

## Reflectance Mechanisms

### Surface reflection (Specular)
Surface reflectance occurs when the light is reflected at the surface. So, the interface is the same point as where the reflectance occurs. It is also known as specular reflection. 

This type of reflection gives objects a glossy or shiny appearance, and materials of smooth surfaces, such as glass, mirrors or polished metal, usually cause specular reflection.

### Body reflection (Diffuse)
The second reflection mechanism is where some of the light enters the material and goes underneath the surface. As materials are typically non-homogeneous, there are particles of different types underneath the surface with different refractive indices. Hence, the light that enters the material gets reflected and refrected many times, bouncing around inside the material. This happens at the skin of the surface in such a random process that, eventually, causes to the light leaving the surface scattered in many different directions.

Body or diffuse reflection gives objects a matte appearance, and materials with non-homogenious medium, such as clay or paper, usually cause such reflection.
