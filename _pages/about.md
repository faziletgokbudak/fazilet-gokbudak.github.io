Hi there! I am a PhD student in Computer Science at the University of Cambridge, working with Dr Cengiz Oztireli. My research aims at helping creative industries by automating manual workflows with machine learning (ML) techniques. During my PhD, I would like to develop techniques that can integrate artist-created models into ML algorithms to manipulate images.

Research interests: 2D Computer Graphics, Computer Vision
