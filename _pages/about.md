I am a final-year PhD student in Computer Science at the University of Cambridge, working with Dr Cengiz Oztireli. My research focuses on machine learning applications for appearance manipulations. My experience in the vision/graphics field includes but is not limited to neural implicit representations (my current project), image generation (Amazon internship, Blackgrass), image-to-image translation (Photo retouching), and classification (Blackgrass).

For details about the projects, please refer to related pages on [Blog Posts](https://faziletgokbudak.github.io/year-archive/) and [Projects](https://faziletgokbudak.github.io/projects/).

**Research interests:** 2D Computer Graphics, Computer Vision, Deep Learning

# News
* Our paper "Hypernetworks for Generalizable BRDF Estimation" is now available on arXiv😊 You can find the paper here: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2311.15783.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2311.15783.pdf). The code and the project website will be available soon too.
* Our paper "One-shot Detail Retouching with Patch Space Neural Transformation Blending" got accepted to ACM SIGGRAPH European Conference on Visual Media Production (CVMP 2023) 🎉😊
* Awarded with Graduate Student Travel Award by Queens' College to attend this year's Siggraph🎉 Looking forward to attending the conference and following up with emerging technologies in computer graphics🤓
* Supervised Artificial Intelligence course this term.

* Completed my internship as an Applied Scientist Intern at Amazon's computer vision research team in Berlin🥳 During my internship, I worked on makeup transfer with generative models.
<!---* Presented our poster entitled “Patch-adaptive Transformation Blending for One-Shot Photo Retouching” at [ICCP 2022](https://iccp2022.iccp-conference.org/), which was held in Caltech, Pasadena, August 1-3, 2022😊
* As one of the organisers, thrilled to announce the ninth Oxbridge Women in Computer Science Conference, which will be held on the 29th of April 2023 in Cambridge, UK. 👩‍💻👨‍💻 For details and registration, please check out our [website](https://fg4051.wixsite.com/oxbridgeconference).--->
